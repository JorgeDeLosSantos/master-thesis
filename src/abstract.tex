The finite element simulation of metal forming processes is an auxiliary tool in the design and optimization of dies. This article presents the analysis of stamping process of an AISI 1018 steel tube, using a two steps progressive tooling. ANSYS/LS-DYNA was used to perform the simulations of dynamic-explicit type, considering the multiples nonlinearities that implies this analysis type, derived from material properties, large strains and contacts between dies and work piece. The results obtained are the maximum force required (1.27 tons) and the maximum stresses (76213 Psi).The resulting geometry of the forming process compared qualitatively with that obtained by the simulation is also shown.
